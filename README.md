Here are some basic guidelines for using GitHub. Hopefully its not too complicated to understand.

We all should now know the username and password for the account. I sent it around a few days ago (I think it was Wednesday). Please keep uploading new versions of our code so we all have a recent copy of it. I think everyone who has some form of code (even if its the wrapper classes) should upload them to GitHub so we can all share it.

To upload a new file, there is a little plus button next to the name of the repository on the screen with all the files listed. You click that, write the file name and then copy your code into the black box. Then PLEASE write a comment at the bottom describing your update etc.
